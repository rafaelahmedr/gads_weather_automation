# Weather-Based Google Ads Campaign Trigger

This project is a lightweight automation system using **Google Ads Scripts (JavaScript)** to dynamically enable or pause ad campaigns based on real-world rainfall data. It integrates with the **Visual Crossing Weather API** and follows rainfall thresholds inspired by the **Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI)**.

---

## Overview

This script helps marketers:
- **Enable** campaigns automatically when recent rainfall exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 20 mm/day)
- **Pause** campaigns when conditions are dry
- **Deliver** smarter, more context-aware ads based on weather events

---

## How It Works

1. Fetches rainfall data from the past 3 days via the Visual Crossing API
2. Checks if rainfall on any day exceeds the defined threshold
3. Enables or pauses the campaign accordingly via Google Ads Scripts

## Rain Intensity Reference (Based on DMI)

| Danish Term        | English Equivalent  | Defined Intensity         |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Let regn           | Light rain          | Less than 2.5 mm/hour     |
| Moderat regn       | Moderate rain       | 2.5–7.6 mm/hour           |
| Kraftig regn       | Heavy rain          | More than 7.6 mm/hour     |
| Skybrud            | Cloudburst          | ≥ 15 mm in 30 minutes     |
| Voldsomt skybrud   | Extreme cloudburst  | ≥ 30 mm in 30 minutes     |
